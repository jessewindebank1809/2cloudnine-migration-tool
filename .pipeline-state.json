    "phase_2": {
      "status": "completed",
      "root_cause": "The CloningService.fetchSourceRecord method only tries a single external ID field when querying for records. It does not handle the case where the source org might use a different external ID field (managed vs unmanaged).",
      "files_to_modify": [
        "src/lib/migration/cloning-service.ts"
      ],
      "related_issues": [],
      "investigation_summary": "The issue occurs because when pcPAYPenalty130 is passed as a record ID, the system assumes it should query using the detected external ID field, but if the source org uses a different field name (External_ID_Data_Creation__c vs tc9_edc__External_ID_Data_Creation__c), the query fails."
    },
    "phase_3": {
      "status": "completed",
      "design_decisions": [
        "Implement a multi-field query approach in fetchSourceRecord method",
        "Try all possible external ID fields: tc9_edc__External_ID_Data_Creation__c, External_ID_Data_Creation__c, External_Id__c",
        "Add comprehensive logging to track which field is being used",
        "Improve error messages to show which fields were attempted",
        "Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality"
      ],
      "implementation_plan": "Update the fetchSourceRecord method to iterate through all possible external ID fields when the recordId is not a Salesforce ID format. This ensures compatibility with both managed and unmanaged package scenarios."
