echo "üöÄ OAuth Callback Fixes Deployment Summary"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED FIXES"
echo "------------------"
echo "1. Enhanced Logging:"
echo "   - Added comprehensive logging to OAuth initiation route"
echo "   - Added detailed logging to OAuth callback route"
echo "   - Track session retrieval, state creation, and validation"
echo "   - Log duplicate check queries and results"
echo ""

echo "2. Better Error Handling:"
echo "   - Improved error messages for session management issues"
echo "   - Added specific error codes for different failure scenarios"
echo "   - Enhanced frontend error message handling"
echo ""

echo "3. State Management Improvements:"
echo "   - Added timestamp to OAuth state for debugging"
echo "   - Better state validation and error reporting"
echo "   - Enhanced organisation ownership verification"
echo ""

echo "4. Database Constraint Monitoring:"
echo "   - Better logging for database constraint violations"
echo "   - Clear identification of P2002 constraint errors"
echo "   - Detailed constraint information in error logs"
echo ""

echo "üîç INVESTIGATION FINDINGS"
echo "------------------------"
echo "‚úÖ Database Schema: CORRECT - Multiple users can connect same Salesforce org"
echo "‚úÖ Query Logic: CORRECT - Duplicate check properly filters by user_id"
echo "‚úÖ Database Constraints: WORKING - @@unique([salesforce_org_id, user_id])"
echo "‚úÖ Test Coverage: COMPREHENSIVE - All scenarios tested and passing"
echo ""

echo "‚ùì ROOT CAUSE STATUS"
echo "------------------"
echo "The core OAuth logic appears to work correctly in isolation."
echo "The issue may be intermittent or related to specific scenarios:"
echo ""
echo "Possible causes still under investigation:"
echo "1. Browser session sharing between tabs/windows"
echo "2. Race conditions in concurrent OAuth flows"
echo "3. Better Auth session persistence edge cases"
echo "4. Network/timing issues in production environment"
echo ""

echo "üìä MONITORING ENHANCEMENTS"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "The deployed logging will now capture:"
echo "- Exact userId values throughout OAuth flow"
echo "- State parameter contents and validation"
echo "- Organisation ownership verification details"
echo "- Duplicate check query parameters and results"
echo "- Database constraint violation specifics"
echo ""

echo "üéØ NEXT STEPS"
echo "------------"
echo "1. Deploy these changes to production"
echo "2. Monitor OAuth flows when users report issues"
echo "3. Analyse logs to identify the exact failure point"
echo "4. Look for patterns in session/state management"
echo ""

echo "üìù MONITORING CHECKLIST"
echo "----------------------"
echo "When issue occurs, check logs for:"
echo "‚ñ° Session retrieval success/failure"
echo "‚ñ° Correct userId in OAuth state creation"
echo "‚ñ° Organisation ownership verification results"
echo "‚ñ° Duplicate check query parameters"
echo "‚ñ° Database constraint violation details"
echo "‚ñ° Any session/state mismatches"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Ready for production deployment with enhanced monitoring!"
